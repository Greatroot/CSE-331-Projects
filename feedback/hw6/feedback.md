#### Overall Feedback

Good job overall! Make sure to check out my more specific feedback. Keep it up as you move towards HW7!

#### More Details
- your command line application should handle any bad input in a graceful way (i.e. the client should not be able to see a crash and exception thrown)
- your main method for MarvelPaths should have some documentation explaining the functionality of the command line application.
- how is the graph constructed from the data file? What are the nodes and edges? This should be specified.
- your pathfinding method should specify that it breaks ties with lexicographical ordering.
- you should include more internal comments in a complex method like `findPath`. "What does this loop do?" is usually a good question to answer in a comment.
