- You should also redraw your lines everytime the size of the grid changes without
the user having to press the draw button again and again (unless ofcourse that
edge cannot be drawn in which case the user much get an error message / alert). 

- Your clear button should also clear the canvas. Currently it just clears the
edge list.
