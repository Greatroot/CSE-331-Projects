This repo contains all of my projects from CSE-331, which all built up to the main and final project: a fully functional app 
that shows you the quickest way to walk between any two buildings on the University of Washington's campus.

CampusPaths is a single-page webapp that allows you to choose two buildings on the University of Washington's campus and draws the 
shortest walking path between those two buildings.
