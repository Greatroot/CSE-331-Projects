# Tests FindPath.findShortestPath() on a graph with island nodes.

created graph g

added node n1 to g
added node n2 to g
added node n3 to g
added node n4 to g
added node n5 to g
added node n6 to g
added node n7 to g

added edge 6.000 from n1 to n2 in g
added edge 10.000 from n2 to n3 in g
added edge 4.000 from n3 to n4 in g

path from n1 to n4:
n1 to n2 with weight 6.000
n2 to n3 with weight 10.000
n3 to n4 with weight 4.000
total cost: 20.000
