/**
 * <b>Graph</b> represents a <b>mutable</b> directed labeled graph, which is a collection of
 * nodes and edges. Each node can be connected one directionally via an edge. For example, node A
 * can be connected to node B by edge E and B is directly reachable from A (A, B). Because of one-way
 * directionality, A cannot be accessed by B using edge E. A new edge must be made for this to happen.
 *
 * <p> For every instance of Graph, there can be any number of edges (zero, one, or more) between a pair of nodes
 * and any number of nodes and edges altogether.
 *
 * <p> Each node's value is unique within an instance of a Graph. As for edges, multiple edges within one
 * instance of Graph can have the same label, with the exception that all labels for edges between the SAME
 * pair of nodes MUST be unique.
 *
 * Specification fields:
 * @spec.specfield parent : Node // If an edge points from node A to node B, A is said to be a parent of node B.
 *
 * @spec.specfield child : Node // If an edge points from node A to node B, B is said to be a child of node A.
 *
 * @spec.specfield relationship : Between Two Nodes // A relationship refers generally to the relationship
 * between two nodes within a graph instance (and only within a graph instance) usually in terms of
 * parent and child (A.K.A. how they are connected via an edge/edges).
 *
 * @spec.specfield neighbor : Node // a neighbor refers to a node that is either a child or parent of another node.
 *  So if Node A had Node B and Node C as parents (edges connected from (B, A) and (C, A)) and Node D as
 *  a child (edge connected from (A, D)), then Nodes B, C, and D are all neighbors of A.
 *
 * @spec.specfield endpoint : Node // Either Node that makes up an edge. If Edge A has the parent Node B
 * and the child Node C, then both Nodes B and C are endpoints of A.
 *
