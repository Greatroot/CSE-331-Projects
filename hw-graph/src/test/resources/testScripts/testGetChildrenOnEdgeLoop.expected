# Tests to see if the graph stores loops between multiple nodes properly (ex: n1 -> n2, n2 -> n1).

created graph g

added node n1 to g
added node n2 to g
added node n3 to g

added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in g
added edge e2 from n2 to n1 in g

g contains: n1 n2 n3

the children of n1 in g are: n2(e1)
the children of n2 in g are: n1(e2)
