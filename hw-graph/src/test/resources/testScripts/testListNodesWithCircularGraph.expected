# Test listing all nodes in a circular graph

created graph graph
added node n1 to graph
added node n2 to graph
added node n3 to graph
added node n4 to graph
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in graph
added edge e2 from n2 to n3 in graph
added edge e3 from n3 to n2 in graph
added edge e4 from n2 to n1 in graph
graph contains: n1 n2 n3 n4
